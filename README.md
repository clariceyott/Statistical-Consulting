# Statistical Consulting: Study of A Staff Perceptions Survey

This is a statistical consulting project for clients from Education and Psychology fields. The schoolwide positive behavior support (SWPBS) is an evidence-based approach for restructuring schoolwide
discipline through a multi-tiered framework of social, emotional, and behavioral supports. It is identified that staff perception of
SWPBS is a major barrier to the SWPBS implementation in many schools. To help schools understand
the staff perceptions, a catalyst
survey tool called Staff Perceptions of Behavior & Discipline (SPBD) was developed. This project is a study of the SPBD survey data.

A PCA-based factor analysis was performed to study the internal validity of the survey. On the other hand, a hierarchical linear
model was used to investigate the effect of some selected school/staff characteristics on the staff support level of SWPBS.
